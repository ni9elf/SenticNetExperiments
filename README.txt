These Python scripts perform knowledge expansion and consistency checks on SenticNet. Refer to report.pdf (download and view for best reading experience) for description and results of experiments.

$ Knowledge expansion:
In knowledge expansion I created new Sentic vectors to augment the existing data base of 50,000 vectors. A total of 6175 new Sentic vectors were created with varying (subjective) accuracy. My expansion strategies are based on two related algorithms to find semantically similar words to a given word.

Algorithm 1:
Execute the script by running "python knowledge_expansion_1.py"

The output will be in the directory "Output/1/" and contain txt and csv files for positive sentic vectors, negative sentic vectors and both polarity combined.

Algorithm 2:
Execute the script by running "python knowledge_expansion_2.py"

The output will be in the directory "Output/2/" and contain txt and csv files for positive sentic vectors, negative sentic vectors and both polarity combined.

$ Consistency checks:
In my consistency checking experiments, I performed both checks within SenticNet and similarity checks between SenticNet and other models.

Execute the script by running "python consistency_check.py"

Results for the following checks should be displayed:
(Intra checks)
Check if the set of 5 semantics of a concept are defined concepts themselves in SenticNet
Check if concepts have duplicate tags
Check for negative intensity for positive polarity concepts and positive intensity for negative polarity concepts
Check if 5 semantics of a concept have the same polarity as the concept
Check for interest-surprise or fear-anger used together in tags of a concept
Check if concepts and their related semantics are lemmatized according to the Morphy function of WordNet called by NLTK
(Inter checks)
Bing Liuâ€™s Opinion Lexicon
MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon
SentiWordNet
Harvard General Inquirer

The Data folder contains the database of other word models used in the inter similarity checks.
